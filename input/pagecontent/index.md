This implementation guide provides implementation resources and guidance in support of applying the WHO recommendations on Clinical Care in Crises / Integrated management of childhood illness:

[WHO recommendations on Integrated management of childhood illness](https://www.who.int/teams/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-health-and-ageing/child-health/integrated-management-of-childhood-illness)

This implementation guide is part of the WHO Smart Guidelines approach to support countries to integrate WHO global data and health recommendations into digital systems accurately and consistently. This new approach to global health in the digital age beings with maternal health and the launch of the [WHO Smart Integrated management of childhood illness Guidlines](https://www.who.int/tools/em-care)

This guide is prepared to facilitate digital implementation of WHO EmCare guidelines by providing FHIR-based computable representations of and implementation guidance for using the key components of the WHO EmCare digital adaptation kit (DAK):


* Business Processes & Workflows
* Core Data Elements
* Decision Support Logic

This guide is a companion to the Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) and should be used side-by-side with it. Implementers are strongly encouraged to make use of the Digital Adaptation Kit as it contains a wealth of context and guidance that is intentionally not duplicated here. The focus of this guide is on the explanation and use of the computable artifacts.

Note that the content of this implementation guide is draft material that has not yet been tested or validated for use in production environments.

Note that this is a working draft currently in progress, and subject to change without notice. The current focus is on representation of generic personas, data elements, decision support logic, and indicators.
